## Dataset

The datasets are:

### Original (`clean_data_en.csv`)

I put together a combined dataset from two publicly-available sources:

- the Twitter" dataset from [t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/tree/master/data), which contains tweets scraped from Twitter.
- the "Wikipedia" dataset from [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) published by Alphabet's [Conversation AI](https://conversationai.github.io/) team, which contains comments from Wikipedia's talk page edits.

### Original translated in italian (`clean_data_it.csv`)

The wikipedia dataset translated to italian from [Jigsaw Train Multilingual Coments (Google API)](https://www.kaggle.com/miklgr500/jigsaw-train-multilingual-coments-google-api).
